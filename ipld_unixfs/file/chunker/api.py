    Chunker API can be used to slice up the file content according
    to specific logic. It is designed with following properties in mind:

    1. **Stateless** - Chunker does not retain any state across the calls. This
       implies that calling `cut` function on the same bytes would produce same
       array of sizes. Do note however, that when chunker is used to chunk
       stream of data it will be **callers responsibility** to carry remaining
       bytes in subsequent calls.

    2. **No side effects** - Chunker does not read from the underlying source
       and MUST not mutate given buffer nor any other outside references
       (including passed arguments). If your chunker is unable to operate
       optimally without interal state changes consider using `StatefulChunker`
       instead.

    3. **Does not manage resources** - Chunker does not manage any resources,
       all the data is passed in and managed by the caller, which allows it to
       control amount of memory to be used.

        Chunker takes a `context: T` object, `buffer` containing bytes to be
        chunked. Chunker is expected to return a list of chunk byte lengths
        (from the start of the buffer). If returned list is empty that signifies
        that the buffer contains no valid chunks.

        **Note:** Consumer of the chunker is responsible for dealing with the
        remaining bytes in the buffer, that is unless `end` is true signalling
        to the chunker that the end of the stream is reached.
