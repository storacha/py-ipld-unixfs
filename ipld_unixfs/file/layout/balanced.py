class Balanced:
    """
    Type representing a state of the balanced tree. First row hold leaves coming
    into a builder, once number of leaves in the stack reaches `maxChildren`
    they are moved into `RootNode` instance which is pushed into the next row of
    nodes. If next row now contains `maxChildren` nodes from there are again
    moved into a new `RootNode` and pushed into next row etc...

    For illustration let's assume we have `maxChildren: 3`, after 3 leafs were
    added tree will have following layout

    ```
    #           (root1)
    #              |
    #    ----------------------
    #    |         |          |
    #  (leaf1)   (leaf2)    (leaf3)
    ```

    Which in our model before flushing is represented as follows:

    ```
    {
      width: 3
      leaf_index: [leaf1, leaf2, leaf3]
      node_index: []
      nodes: []
    }
    ```

    After flushing 3 leaves (which is width) are moved into a `RootNode` that
    is added to `nodes` array (and returned so that caller can create a block).
    Additionally position of the added node is captured in the `index` at an
    appropriate depth `0` (that is because we don't count leaves into depth).

    ```
    {
      width: 3
      leaf_index: []
      node_index: [[0]]
      nodes: [RootNode([leaf1, leaf2, leaf3])]
    }
    ```

    Increasing number of leaves to 10 would produce following tree layout

    ```
    #                                                          (root7)
    #                                                            |
    #                                    ------------------------------------------
    #                                    |                                        |
    #                                  (root4)                                  (root6)
    #                                    |                                        |
    #            -------------------------------------------------                |
    #            |                       |                       |                |
    #          (root1)                 (root2)                 (root3)          (root5)
    #            |                       |                       |                |
    #    --------|--------       --------|--------       --------|--------        |
    #    |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |        |
    #  (leaf1) (leaf2) (leaf3) (leaf4) (leaf5) (leaf6) (leaf7) (leaf8) (leaf9) (leaf10)
    ```

    Which in our model will look as follows (note we do not have root5 - root7
    in model because they are build once width is reached or once builder is
    closed)

    ```
    {
      width: 3
      leaf_index: [leaf10]
      node_index: [
        [0, 1, 2], // [r1, r2, r3]
